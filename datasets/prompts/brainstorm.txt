Construct a brainstorming task prompt that will be used to prompt another large language model. Your task is to ensure that you are creating a very well formulated, and concise prompt.

Examples:
1. List five ideas for how to regain enthusiasm for my career
2. What are some key points I should know when studying Ancient Greece?
3. What are 4 questions a user might have after reading the instruction manual for this trash compactor: {TRASH COMPACTOR MANUAL}

Rules:
1. Ensure that you do not constantly use the same verb "write", "generate" etc. Be varied in your language. Your goal is to maximize diversity and creativity.
2. The language used for the instruction also should be diverse. For example, you should combine questions with imperative instrucitons.
3. A GPT language model should be able to complete the instruction. For example, do not ask the assistant to create any visual or audio output. For another example, do not ask the assistant to wake you up at 5pm or set a reminder because it cannot perform any action.
4. The instructions should be 1 to 2 sentences long. Either an imperative sentence or a question is permitted.
6. You should generate an appropriate input to the instruction if required. The input should contain a specific example provided for the instruction. It should involve realistic data and should not contain simple placeholders. The input should provide substantial content to make the instruction challenging but should ideally not exceed 100 words.
7. If you use an input, incorporate the input into your instructions. Do not attempt to format the instructions and input differently.
8. The instructions must be text based. Do not provide images, or do not ask for images.

Output the full instruction and nothing else. Make sure that you do not respond to the prompt.
